# PubSub
An ***RESTful-like*** HTTP service to make signing up for event streams easy and open to anyone able to access the URI endpoint. Useful for passing in things like uptime stats.

> Pubsub guarentees '*at least once*' message delilvery - up until the subscription to the topic becomes *stale* after a period of inactivity

Acknowledgement based system to ensure message delivery guarentees are met.
- Push Subscriptions (Webhooks) need return a 200 or 201 status code to acknowlege. 
- Message pull subscriptions acknowlege message receipt of earlier pointer positions when requesting a later pointer position.

### RESTful-like?
This implementation aims to be familiar for people used to integrating RESTful services without being strictly compliant with any common definition.

The API is designed to be fully accessible purely through GET HTTP requests, in order to make it open to clients that do not have ready access to the full set of HTTP CRUD methods (e.g. browsers, webtool UIs, spreadsheets, etc). 

To make this work, a custom verb list is used for appending to standardised endpoints. All arguments can be given through query parameters on static general URI paths.

If you prefer to pass arguments via JSON in the request body, you can still do so using the same static endpoints - or mix the two options.

## Project Goals
This project aims to provide a performant publish and subscribe server for use in local testing and small-to-medium production workloads where event messages are non sensitive. To be easily parachuted into projects with simple deployment, memorable API and SSE interface for web apps.

In priority order:

> Goal 1: Simple to run

- Packaged in single Dockerfile.
- Evaluate on Replit with a click.

Deploy with a `docker run` command and config with command line args or envars if you want to.

Familiar to newcomers with some knowledge of APIs, with an interface simple and small enough to fit into working memory.

> Goal 2: Accessible to use

Initially built for delivering open data to public consumers, focus is on open accessibility. 
- Easy to discover and subscribe to message streams with a single command.
- Easy to publish streams to websites using SSE

> Goal 3: Fast & efficient

The aim is to be quick *enough* and not use excessive resource. Our aim is to run a throughput of 60MB per second with a latency of 25 ms (200 MB/s load) on a Raspberry pi with resource to spare.

PubSub Benchmarks to follow (*see Roadmap section*)

## Status
**pubSub** is in initial development (v0) stage and subject to constant change to its API.

**Not yet suitable for deployment in production environments**

## Data Persistance
Pubsub is an in-memory system, however it persists message data to a file-based KV database and blob stores in future to assist with disaster recovery efforts.

When implemented, messages are stored in JSON format within a local blob store with file name convention: `{topicName}/{messageID}`

Both subscriber and user lists are stored in GOB format within a local BoltDB KV store with:

 - User keys convention: `user/{userID}`

 - Subscriber keys convention: `sub/{topicName}/{messageID}/{subscriberID}`

Data storage shadows the in memory workflow and will only be called in the event of disaster recovery.

All persisted data will be in the directory `/store` when run via the docker container with defaults.This can be persisted from the Docker container using volumes such as using the command ` docker run --volumes-from [...]`. To change the location, set the environment variable `PS_STORE`.

## Usage
### Request Params
Parameters can be sent by URL query, HTTP Post  JSON payload or a mixture of both.

example URL encoded:
```http
https://some.endpoint/users/user/obtain?username=usrname&password=pswrd
```

JSON format for post requests with all params: 
```JSON
{
  "username"    : "username",
  "password"    : "password",
  "topic"       : "topic name",
  "webhook_url" : "https://webhook-url.dev",
  "message"     : "A text message which could be anything - XML, JSON, markdown, etc",
  "message_id"  : 0,
}
```
Go Struct representation:
```go
//IncomingReq is the standard structure for message requests to the service
type IncomingReq struct{
  //Username is a mandatory field
  Username    string       `json:"username"`
  //Password is a mandatory field
  Password    string       `json:"password"`
  //Topic is the `name` of the topic requested 
  Topic       string       `json:"topic,omitempty"`
  //WebhookURL (aka PushURL) for push subscription to topic
  WebhookURL  string       `json:"webhook_url,omitempty"`
  //Message used for writing messages to services
  Message     interface{}  `json:"message,omitempty"`
  //MessageID used for pulling messages from topics
  MessageID   int          `json:"message_id,omitempty"`
}
```

## Object Life Cycles & Limitations
### Users
> A **User** is a disposable object that identifies credentials associated with a group of subscriptions.

1. They are garbage collected when they are no longer associated with subscriptions.
1. They are created passively when a username/password pair are used to subscribe or create a topic, so long as username does not exist already (this results in a failed request with an unauthorised access header).
1. If successfull the **User** will either be logged in to an existing **User** (if password matches) or a new **User** created and immediately logged in to perform the action.
1. You do not need to login explicitly using the `/users/user/obtain` endpoint, but it may be useful to check when the **User** was created or see which Topics it is subscribed to.
  
### Topics 
> A **Topic** is a is a container for a stream of related messages.

1. A **Topic** can be passively created if any **User** attempts to write to the topic by sending a request to the `topics/topic/create` endpoint. In which case that user will become the creator of the topic, and the only **User** authorised to write to it.
    1. You can check who is the creator of an existing **Topic** without fear of passively creating it by using the `/topics/fetch` endpoint 
1. When a **Topic** no longer has any subscribers, it is garbage collected.
    1.  This should not cause issues as the **User** that is the creator of a **Topic** is automatically subscribed to it. So by default a new **Topic** will have 1 subscriber.
1.  The creator's **Subscription** is always at the head position for a **Topic** to which it is the creator even without consuming or acknowledging any messages -and will not get in the way of tombstoning and garbage collection of old messages.
    1.  The **Subscription** can still go stale, be tombstoned and eventually garbage collected by not writing to the stream. This will allow the Topic to be garbage collected as it will no longer have subscribers. You can prevent this by writing to the stream again - which will remove the active tombstones.

### Subscription
> A **Subscription** is an association of a **User** with a **Topic** to which the User wishes to be updated of new incoming **Messages**. It is used to maintain the position of the next message yet to be read by the **User** in the **Topic** queue.

1. A **Subscription** is garbage collected if no new read acknoledgements have been received before the 'gone Stale' deadline.
    1. This can be an issue when the **Topic** publishes messages at a very low frequency and the subscription is `push`. However it is necarssary to garbage collect inactive **Topics**. Configurations to the garbage collector (tombstoner config) can remedy this.   

### Messages
> A **Message** is the unit of data published to the **Topic** by the publisher to be consumed by the subscriber

1. **Messages** that have been consumed and acknowleged by all subscribers are garbage collected. 
1. Add a pushURL/WebhookURL to subscribe as a push subscriber. Otherwise you will have to pull the message via retrieval endpoint with a messageID to get the next message. You cannot mix methods or change subscription type after initial subscripton, without first unsubscribing and subscribing again.
    1. You can do this in one action by using the `/topics/topic/subscribe` endpoint. However the subscription pointer will move to the Topic's head position and previous messages may become unobtainable.

## Roadmap
- [x] Timed garbage collection of stale subscribers by first tombstoning subscribers preventing deletion of tickets over 50 places behind PointerHead, then deleting them on second pass if they are still there after a certain amount of time. Designed to prevent inactive subscribers forcing long term storage of messages (to maintain a stable service)
- [x] Timed pushing of messages to Webhook URLs
- [x] Implement deletion of User when no longer subscribed to any topic
- [x] Implement deletion of Topic when no longer has any subscribers
- [x] Implement Errors being parsed back to client via standard error object rather than status 5xx pages 
- [x] Persist messages in key-value database for disaster recovery
- [ ] Error managment for issues that come up in `pubsub.metranome`
- [x] Include a Dockerfile/Containerfile for easy deployment
- [ ] Inlude a Cloud Build YAML file for easy CICD to GCP Cloud Compute Engine
- [x] Add a Bash script for easy local deploy for testing using Buildah and Podman
- [x] Server Sent Events implementation for websites wanting to consume streams to display directly in the client UI
- [x] Implement front end web app for onboarding new users
- [ ] Benchmarking
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Inform Push subscribers when their subscriptions have been garbage collected as this may be due to low frequency publishing rates of the Topic rather than inactive subscribers.
- [ ] Add ability to config the tombstoner deadlines.
- [x] Fix User already exists bug that effeects users after restore from persistance layer
